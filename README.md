# Testing fake API placeholder service

 I was just testing JSONPlaceholder platform for fake API service simulation for front-end development speed up.  
Current address: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/MDUkauskas/testfakeapi

To create it for yourself all you need to do is:
1. create the repository you want to use for fake API service.
2. create file in root directory of master branch
3. Go to this address https://my-json-server.typicode.com/{github account}/{repo name}.
